# Real_Time_Edge_Detection_Viewer
 This project is a real-time edge detection Android app using OpenCV and C++ (NDK). It captures frames from the device camera, processes them natively with OpenCV for edge detection, and displays the result using OpenGL or Android views. It demonstrates efficient native image processing on mobile platforms.
